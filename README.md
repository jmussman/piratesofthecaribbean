# Pirates of the Caribbean

This site is used to park the domain names piratesofthecaribbean.live and potc.live.
I like to use the names of dead pirates for programming and administrative examples.
Maybe I should call this list the "Dead pirates league"!

* edwardteach@potc.live
* charlesvane@potc.live
* blackbeard@potc.live
* annebonney@potc.live
* maryread@potc.live
* jackratham@potc.live
* bartroberts@potc.live
* henrymorgan@potc.live
* williamkidd@potc.live
* sambellamy@potc.live

Enjoy!
