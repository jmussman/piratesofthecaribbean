# Pirates of the Caribbean

This site is used to park the domain names [piratesofthecaribbean.live](https://piratesofthecaribbean.live) and [potc.live](https://potc.live).
I like to use the names of dead pirates from the "Golden age of piracy" for programming and administrative examples.
Maybe I should call this list the "Dead pirates league"!

Up to Sam Bellamy these email addresses mirror the images in the montage on the site (yes, two of them are women!).
I couldn't find a period image of Black Sam, so a drawing of his ship the Whydah Gally is in the montage.
The Whydah was located in 1984 off of Cape Code in fourteen feet of water.
In 2021 bone fragments were retrieved near a pistol known to belong to Black Sam and DNA tested against his descendants.
Black Caesar was a former slave who operated South of Elliot Key in Biscayne Bay in the early 18th century, he may have been captured in the
battle where Blackbeard died and later hanged.

This project demonstrates HTML5/CSS3 and is an example of using ES6+ (JavaScript 6/2016+) with jQuery to manipulate elements.

Enjoy!
